    "content": "These are the rules I use for running Partners in the Campaigns that I run, be they Play-By-Post or otherwise. To unlock Partners to fill out your Party, you have two options. 1) You can find an NPC somewhere in the world that you like, and convince them to join you on your adventure. This requires a Persuade (or Bully if you want to coerce them through fear instead) Check, requiring at least a Good! to succeed. For every Partner you already have, the required Grade of Success needed increases by one. Keep in mind, some Partners may be more difficult to unlock than others. 2) Build a character following the rules below, which then the GM can place that character somewhere in the world for you to find. This option will let you unlock a Partner without rolling a Skill Check, however, it's entirely up to the GM to let you find them in the first place. If they don't want you to have the Partner or you just never look in the right place, you just won't get the Partner. When it comes to building Characters to use a Partner, it's very similar to building a Level 1 Player Character. The only difference is their starting HP, FP, BP, SP, the number of Negative Traits each Technique is allowed to benefit from, and their Inventory. On top of this, their Level is referred to as a Rank and can only reach as high as Level 4, to most accurately match the Partners from the first two Paper Mario games (A fourth and fifth Rank being added to match the progression of Mushroom based Items in some of the games). Their Rank progression looks as follows: . Basic Rank . Known Techniques: 2 . # of Negative Traits per Technique: 4 . Bonus to Basic Rank's Power: +0 . Maximum HP based on perceived Role: . | DPS: 10 | Tank: 15 | Support: 10 | . Super Rank . Known Techniques: 3 . # of Negative Traits per Technique: 5 . Bonus to Basic Rank's Power: +1 .

    "content": "A Partner doesn't gain HP based on their Heart, instead they are assigned a role by the DM based on what their percieved functionality is. Their Maximum HP each Rank is based on this role, usually, but not always increasing by +10 HP each Rank. A DM may adjust these numbers, or even make new roles, as best befits the situation and Parnter at hand. A Partner can only Rank Up by offering Shine Sprites, Power Stars, Power Moons, Super Blocks, or other similarly powerful Items to someone who can harness their power, like Shamans, Merlon being the prime example. As for their FP, BP, and SP, they must use the Player Character's for whom they are the Partner of. You can equip Badges to them using your BP, each Badge applying to the specific Partner it is equipped to, P versions of Badges applying to all your Partners instead. Example: P Badges . You have two Partners named Tom and Jerry and 6/6 BP to spend on equiping Badges. Normally you could use that BP to equip a Power Plus Badge to yourself, but when equipping the Badge, you could instead assign it to one of your Partners, and grant, let's say Jerry the +1 Power instead. In this instance, only Jerry gets the +1 Power, you and Tom do not. If you had a Power Plus P Badge instead, when you equip it, you don't assign it at all. You are never elegible for the effects of a P Badge, instead, both Tom, Jerry, and any other Partners you might gain in the future, benefit from the +1 Power. Similarly, Partners can have Gear equipped to them, and some may even come with Basic Gear tied to their [Tool] Techniques. Such Gear is so generic and handwavey, it doesn't require Inventory Slots. However, if you wish to get them better Gear, or swap out their Gear entirely for something else, they do not have an Inventory of their own to hold such things, instead taking up space in the Inventory of the Player Character. Due to this, they also cannot carry any Items, but can use Items from the Inventory of the Player Character they are the Partner of instead. In regards to FP and SP, since they do not have FP and SP of their own, they can not restore either of these stats. If an effect would restore the FP and/or SP of a Partner, but not the Player Character, the Player Character's FP and/or SP is restored instead. If an effect would restore the FP and/or SP of both the Partner and Player Character, the Player Character's FP and/or SP is, however, only restored once. In addition to this, Partners can use the SP generated for Exceptional Results to improve the effect of their Technique being used instead of having it restore the Player Character's SP. Finally, when being assisted in a Skill Check, you may only have one Partner assist you on any given Check, so it is better to gather a wider variety of Partners rather than building a coven of all high Magic users.

If you have multiple Spin Dash Badges, you can use them together by spending 1 FP for each additional Badge. Treat [X] as the number of Spin Dash Badges used. Spin Dash Rolls into a ball and revs up before charging forward, going through grounded enemies. Athletics (+Spin): Nice!: [Power] DMG Good!: [2 x Power] DMG (Solid Hit) The attack then repeats with a Strike on up to [X] valid targets behind the first, at the same elevation. Each new Strike deals 1 less Raw Damage than the last; this can't reduce the Raw Damage below 0, so as long as the first strike could deal damage, the rest will deal at least 1 Raw Damage. If the initial Strike was a Solid Hit, the subsequent Strikes are too. Ring Defense . BadgeDefense • ? BP • ??? Coins . You can forego your Guard and Dodge reactions, and instead choose to tank through Rings/Coins. When you would take damage, you can spend Rings/Coins to reduce the damage taken, at a rate of 10 for 1 HP saved. This does not allow you to trigger a Superguard, or to defend against Weaknesses. Other results of reducing damage to 0 apply as normal. Emerald Drain . BadgeBoon • ? BP • ??? Coins . Final design by @lucydndprincess . Having this badge equipped bestows you the following State: . State: (Un)Inhibited Chaos . Your connection to the powers of Chaos/The Stars have been Inhibited in some way. While Inhibited, you cannot spend SP in any way, or Share it with your Teammates. When your SP reaches it's Maximum, you can become Uninhibited. Treat [X] as your Maximum SP divided by 10. While Uninhibited, you lose 1 SP at the Start of each of your Turns for each Turn you've been Uninhibited. In addition to this, all of your Techniques spend SP as if they had Alt-Cost (SP) although Techniques can go down to 0 SP; you have +[X] ATK, and you get +[X]d6 to any Skill Check made outside of Battle. When you run out of SP, you take [X] x 2 Damage. This HP loss can't be resisted in any way (including Defense or Secure) and ignores the user's Weaknesses, Resistances or Immunities. Slingshot Carrier . BadgeAttack • ?? BP • ?? Coins . You can use a Carried ally to power-up your Techniques. When using the power of this Badge, you hit your target with your ally, either by hurling them at the target, or using them as a projectile, depending on the Technique used. At the user's option, this Technique's Primary check can use Athletics instead. Any Contact Traits trigger between your Carried ally and the other target. Treat the Technique as if you had +[X] Attack, where [X] is the Power of your Carried ally. Your Carried ally can add one of their Tech Defaults, or one of the Technique Traits of one of their 0 FP Techniques, to the Technique. After the Technique resolves, your ally is no longer Carried, and can place themselves in a space adjacent to you. Throwing Blaze is a good way to deal Fire damage, while Sonic can be useful to make sure my attacks are Homing on my foes, or Pierce their defenses! . Team Blast . BadgeTechnique • ? BP • ??? Coins . For 10 SP, you can claim to perform a Team Blast when using a Technique. The Technique receives the Group positive Trait and the Team negative Trait twice. The participating allies can add one of their Tech Defaults, or one of the Technique Traits of one of their 0 FP Techniques, to the Technique. If the included Traits include Traits that would normally be meant to help allies (Like Hearty or Boost), the Technique can include a single Split Slot that can't contain any Strikes and targets the participants to the Team Blast. Participating allies can pay 5 SP to add another instance of a Trait they already contributed to the Technique. This can be done multiple times. Treat the Technique as if you had +[X] Attack, where [X] is the half of he combined Power of the participants. Team Move . BadgeTechnique • ? BP • ??? Coins . When you first receive this Badge, select one to three allies to create a Technique with. Design this Technique as you would any other, with the following changes: . | The Technique includes the Team negative Trait for every ally participating to the Technique. Those Traits reduce the FP Cost, but don't count towards your usual negative Traits Limit for FP Cost reduction. | Each ally participating to the Technique can add one of their Tech Defaults, or one of the Technique Traits of one of their 0 FP Techniques, to the Technique. | The Technique has Cooldown x3. Those Traits don't count towards FP Cost reduction. | When using the Technique, treat it as if you had +[X] Attack, where [X] is the half of he combined Power of the participants. | The BP cost of this badge is equal to the effective FP Cost/5. | . Once designed, the Badge is locked to the current Technique and participants, and can only be equipped by the user who designed the Technique. If you need to redesign the Technique or reset the badge altogether, you can ask a Craftman to help you unlock it, requiring to Work from Scratch on the badge for an equivalent cost of 50 Coins multiplied by its BP Cost. No additional materials are required. The badge is unusable while it's being worked on. ",
