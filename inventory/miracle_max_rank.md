# Max & Miracle Gear
{: .no_toc }

Some games sometimes need to go higher when it comes to power levels, and for this reason, Lucy created some new Ranks of Gear to go beyond Ultra, called *Miracle*{: .miracle-color } and *Max*{: .max-color }.

> > These Techniques can include one Trait as a Tech Default, based on the Gear's primary use (e.g. Tool for weapons, or Aerial for boots).  
> > Regardless of the user's level, only 6 Traits can be used to reduce the Technique's *FP cost*{: .spirit-color }.
- Traits can be added for a further 100 Coins each, with their numerical values values (e.g. Resist, *HP*{: .heart-color } healed with Immune, Contact damage) beginning at 1.  
> > Each numerical effect of a Trait can be increased, 1 point at a time, for another 100 Coins.
