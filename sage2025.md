As a way to celebrate trying to get Paper Story a booth for SAGE2025, the community has come together to create a small collection of Sonic-themed homebrew content for the game, including Species, new expanded Rules, and more!

While this content is not official, Deuce himself participated in a good chunk of it, and we can proudly present it to you all!

# Species

As a way to encompass the wide variety of characters seen in the Sonic franchise, and offer a good framework for players to create OCs that fit the Sonic-style, we decided to create a unique "Mobian" species, with a number of options to customise them to your liking.

> Mobians are the most common inhabitants of Sonic's World, anthropomorphic animals with a variety of appearances and abilities. While most Mobians take from real-world mammals, they can also include birds, reptiles, and even aquatic creatures.  
> While not all Mobians are fighters by trade, their culture has for long been deeply intertwined with conflicts on a global scale, leading to a strong warrior ethos among many, and the courage to stand up against oppression.

# Subspecies

Subspecies are means to further customise a character. A bunch of them are already available in the core rulebook, but we thought that Sonic deserved some unique ones around a specific theme.. Here comes Speed-Type-, Power-Type- and Fly-Type- Subspecies!
