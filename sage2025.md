> Mobians are the most common inhabitants of Sonic's World, anthropomorphic animals with a variety of appearances and abilities. While most Mobians take from real-world mammals, they can also include birds, reptiles, and even aquatic creatures.  
> While not all Mobians are fighters by trade, their culture has for long been deeply intertwined with conflicts on a global scale, leading to a strong warrior ethos among many, and the courage to stand up against oppression.
