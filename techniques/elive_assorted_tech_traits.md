Whenever possible, Traits used elsewhere from this page will have the [Elive] suffix to indicate their origin.

## Trait Effects

Some Traits have similar functions which are referred to in shorthand, explained here.

{: .content-callout }
> ### [Custom]
> 
> An aspect of this technique can be changed to suit the user's future needs. Such changes can typically only be made outside of tense situations.  
> At GM's discretion however, this rule can be sidestepped with a proper check.

## Positive Technique Traits

{: .content-callout }
> ### *Kit*{: .positive-color} *(+2 FP)*{: .spirit-color } [Custom] [X]
> 
> The technique's parameters can be slightly altered for different styles of action. Choose up to *[XX] FP*{: .spirit-color } in the technique's other traits (besides default, optional, and required traits).  
> During technique creation, The user can choose an alternate *[XX] FP*{: .spirit-color }'s worth of technique traits to be swapped with the selected traits when outside of tense situations (Applicable optional and required traits can also be swapped).  
> You may have up to 3 different kits to choose from.

{: .content-callout }
> ### *Overclock*{: .positive-color} *(+1 FP)*{: .spirit-color } [Custom] [X - Cap 5]
> 
> The technique can be slowly, but easily, altered for more advanced use.  
> Outside of tense situations, the user may choose a level between 0 to [X] for [Z].  
> Both checks required for this technique require [Z] extra grade(s) of success (As if it had Unwieldy), but on success: the total Raw Damage increases by [ZZ] and the technique automatically generates [Z] SP, but this extra SP cannot be used for exceptional techniques.

{: .content-callout }
> ### *Wild*{: .positive-color} *(+?? FP)*{: .spirit-color } [Target] [Random]
> 
> The user tries to attack any enemy they can with this technique, regardless of who it ends up being.  
> Any potential target that can be reached from the user's current elevation (Regardless of who's in front of them) can be targeted, but fate (Be it GM's call or a dice roll) decides who ends up being targeted.  
> This trait can be taken with other [Random] traits.
>
> If this technique is on a single-strike technique or a multi-strike technique meant for a single target, it costs *+1 FP*{: .spirit-color }.  
>
> If this technique is on a multi-strike technique meant for multiple targets, it costs *+2 FP*{: .spirit-color }.

{: .content-callout }
> ### *Exit*{: .positive-color} *(+2 FP)*{: .spirit-color } [X] [Secondary - *Athletics*{: .heart-color }/*Trickery*{: .spirit-color }/*Magic*{: .spirit-color }/*Bully*{: .courage-color }]
> 
> The user attempts to remove certain targets from the field (Including themselves), even if they are not properly subdued yet.  
> If this is attempted on non-willing targets, it automatically requires an extra grade of success for every 5 HP they still have, but should it succeed, you may assign any extra grades of success to another target that would now be in range to attempt to remove them as well, up to a maximum of [X] targets.
>
> Enemy targets who leave combat this way do not count to potential rewards (Star Points, Coins, Items, # of Enemies KO'ed statistics).
>
> Depending on how this check is executed narratively, the technique may allow for the targets to travel a certain distance without needing to worry about checks (Such as back to a previously known safe location).

## Negative Technique Traits

{: .content-callout }
> ### *Fleeting*{: .negative-color} *(-2 FP)*{: .spirit-color } [X]
>
> (Meant for [Champion Techniques]())
>
> The user expends a bit of the energy keeping them tied to the world when using this technique.  
> When this technique is used, the turns remaining for the summoned champion is reduced by [X].  
> The technique can't be used if their number of remaining turns is less than [X], and the champion is immediately de-summoned after the technique if it leads to them having 0 turns left.
